**Project:** SmartShield.AI
**Theme:** AI for Good / Cybersecurity
**Target Time:** 2:00

### [0:00 - 0:15] The Hook 🪝
**(Visual: Hold a printed QR sticker to the camera. Peel it slightly to show it's a sticker.)**

**Speaker:** "Do you trust this?"
*(Pause for 1 second)*
**Speaker:** "You shouldn't. This is a 10-rupee sticker. And with just this sticker, I can hijack a shop's entire daily revenue. This is a 'UPI Overlay Attack', and it affects millions of unsuspecting users every day."

### [0:15 - 0:45] The Problem 🛑
**(Visual: B-roll or screen recording of news clippings about QR fraud, or a reenactment of someone pasting a sticker on a shop counter.)**

**Speaker:** "In the rush of digital payments, we've lost context. Payment apps act as blind pipes—they just read the code and send the money. They don't know if the QR code belongs to the coffee shop you're standing in, or a scammer sitting miles away."
**Speaker:** "The physical layer of security is completely missing. Until now."

### [0:45 - 1:15] The Demo 📱
**(Visual: Cut to your Laptop Screen. Show the SmartShield SOC Dashboard.)**

**Speaker:** "Meet SmartShield.AI. The real-time guardian for digital transactions. Watch this."

**(Action: Click 'Live Scanner' on the Dashboard sidebar. The sci-fi HUD appears.)**

**Speaker:** "I'm going to scan a legitimate merchant code first."
**(Action: Scan the 'Safe' Starbucks QR. Green 'Verified Safe' Modal pops up nicely.)**
**Speaker:** "Instantly verified. The AI recognizes the merchant patterns and gives us a green shield."

**(Action: Close modal. Hold up the 'Fake' Scam QR.)**
**Speaker:** "Now, let's try the sticker I showed you earlier."
**(Action: Scan the 'Scam' QR. Red 'Threat Detected' Modal flashes with alarm.)**
**Speaker:** "Boom. Blocked. Our engine detected the high-risk UPI handle and flagged the anomaly before a single rupee left the account."

### [1:15 - 1:45] The Tech 🧠
**(Visual: Show an architecture diagram slide or briefly start at the Dashboard metrics.)**

**Speaker:** "How do we do it? We built a 3-layer defense system hosted on **Microsoft Azure**."
1.  **Computer Vision:** Analyzes the visual integrity of the code.
2.  **Azure AI:** Predicts fraud probability based on transaction context.
3.  **Real-Time Latency:** Powered by Azure Functions and Static Web Apps to ensure checks happen in milliseconds.

### [1:45 - 2:00] The Ask 🚀
**(Visual: Team standing together or a slide with the SmartShield.AI Logo.)**

**Speaker:** "Fraud evolves, and so should our security. We are Team [Your Team Name], and with SmartShield.AI, we are on a mission to protect the next billion digital transactions."
**Speaker:** "SmartShield.AI. Scan Safe. Pay Safe. Thank you."
